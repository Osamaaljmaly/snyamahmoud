                        Water, a substance composed of the chemical elements hydrogen and oxygen and existing in gaseous,
                        liquid, and solid states. It is one of the most plentiful and essential of compounds. A tasteless
                        and odourless liquid at room temperature, it has the important ability to dissolve many other substances.
                        Indeed, the versatility of water as a solvent is essential to living organisms. Life is believed to have
                        originated in the aqueous solutions of the world’s oceans, and living organisms depend on aqueous solutions,
                        such as blood and digestive juices, for biological processes. In small quantities water appears colourless,
                        but water actually has an intrinsic blue colour caused by slight absorption of light at red wavelengths.

                       Although the molecules of water are simple in structure (H2O), the physical and chemical properties of the
                       compound are extraordinarily complicated, and they are not typical of most substances found on Earth. For example,
                       although the sight of ice cubes floating in a glass of ice water is commonplace, such behaviour is unusual for chemical
                       entities. For almost every other compound, the solid state is denser than the liquid state; thus, the solid would sink to
                       the bottom of the liquid. The fact that ice floats on water is exceedingly important in the natural world, because the ice that
                       forms on ponds and lakes in cold areas of the world acts as an insulating barrier that protects the aquatic life below. If ice were
                       denser than liquid water, ice forming on a pond would sink, thereby exposing more water to the cold temperature. Thus, the pond would
                       eventually freeze throughout, killing all the life-forms present.

                        Water occurs as a liquid on the surface of Earth under normal conditions, which makes it invaluable for transportation, for recreation,
                        and as a habitat for a myriad of plants and animals. The fact that water is readily changed to a vapour (gas) allows it to be transported
                        through the atmosphere from the oceans to inland areas where it condenses and, as rain, nourishes plant and animal life. (See hydrosphere:
                        The hydrologic cycle for a description of the cycle by which water is transferred over Earth.)</p>

                                        In the hydrologic cycle, water is transferred between the land surface,
                                          the ocean, and the atmosphere. The numbers on the arrows indicate relative
                                          water fluxes.
